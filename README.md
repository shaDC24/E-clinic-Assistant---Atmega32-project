# E-clinic-Assistant---Microprocessor-project

🏥 E-Clinic Assistant – Microprocessor Project
🔹 Overview

This project implements a microcontroller-based patient queue management and health monitoring system using ATmega32.
It collects patient information, monitors vital signs, and automates the doctor–patient call process with both LCD displays and Bluetooth integration.

🔹 Features

Collects patient info (Name, Age, Phone) via keypad.

Measures temperature (LM35) and pulse rate (Heartbeat sensor).

Displays information on multiple LCDs:

Patient registration info

Waiting room updates

Doctor’s display with current patient details

Doctor can call next patient via push button.

HC-05 Bluetooth connects doctor’s mobile to call the patient directly.

Buzzer alert + Serial number display at patient’s side.

🔹 Components Used

ATmega32 Microcontroller

4x4 Keypad

LM35 Temperature Sensor

Heartbeat Sensor

16x2 LCD Displays (x3)

HC-05 Bluetooth Module

Push Button & Buzzer

Power Supply

🔹 Workflow

Patient enters details on the keypad.

Sensors measure temperature & pulse rate.

Data is displayed on the LCDs.

The doctor presses a button to call the next patient.

Bluetooth module triggers a phone call.

Patient side LCD + buzzer alerts the next patient.

🔹 Applications

Hospitals & clinics for patient queue management.

Collecting basic health parameters before doctor consultation.

Enhancing doctor efficiency and reducing manual tasks.
